## :troll_face: Moneroff

__‚ùç__ An offline Monero key generator & transaction signer in Rust.

&nbsp;

***

### :clipboard: To Do:

- [x] Add key generation ability.
- [x] Add CLI arg support w/ docopt.
- [x] Add key set generation from existing.
- [x] Make sensible key type so that sizes are enforced!
- [ ] Have way to save and load from encrypted key file(s).
- [ ] how does monero encrypt the files (if it does?)
- [ ] Make work w/ multiple keys
- [ ] Use inquirerjs style menu (rustbox?) for picking which key to sign with.
- [ ] Add ability to add/rm keys (make latter require p-word of that key!).

### :wrench: Build it:

__`cargo +nightly build --release`__
Note the use of nightly since we're using the __`try_trait`__ in order to unwrap options into Results and thus use the __`?`__ operator on both in the same fxn.

### :school_satchel: Test it:
