## :fire: Moneroff

__‚ùç__ An offline monero transaction signer in Rust

&nbsp;

***

### To Do:

- [ ] Add key generation ability (how does monero encrypt the files (if it does?)
- [ ] Make work w/ multiple keys
- [ ] Use inquirerjs style menu (rustbox?) for picking which key to sign with
- [ ] Add ability to add/rm keys (make latter require p-word of that key!)
